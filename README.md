# gatsby-drupal-blog

This repo contains the labs (and final project!) for the workshop at DrupalCamp 2019.

## Getting Started

We _highly_ recommend using `yarn`. If you haven't already, please [install Yarn][yarn-install] to most effectively complete these labs and get started using Gatsby + Drupal.

To validate machine setup, run `yarn validate` to ensure you are using the correct versions of packages!

Once validated, run `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies for _all_ the labs.

## Usage

Each folder within `labs` is a self-contained project (e.g. `lab01`, `lab02`, `final`, etc.) where you will make your changes. Before starting a new lab, be sure to `cd` to the appropriate directory!
